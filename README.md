# Visual Copy
*Lightweight utility that highlights the application that successfully copied data into clipboard*

Reimplementation of [Kevin Gosse](https://x.com/KooKiz/)'s original idea
for his [ClipPing](https://github.com/kevingosse/ClipPing) application.

This is a pure Win32 application that adds extra animation and optionally a sound effect to the active window
whenever clipboard content changes.

## Status

Functional. There are several known visual issues and a lot of space for performance improvements.

And the Debug build settings are broken.

## Features

* Minimal footprint
* Multiple different animations and settings
* Optional scissors snap audio effect

## Minimal requirements

* Windows Vista
* 32-bit colors
* Memory usage typically peaks at about 8 MB of RAM

## TODO:

* Create good icon. Ideally in style that'd fit also Windows 7 and 8.
